                <p>Born and raised in Halifax I always knew I wanted a fun job where I could express my creativity
                    and flaunt my organizational skills. I decided to go to Culinary school to become a Pastry Chef. 
                    My career as a Pastry Chef has taken me all over the world; from Ottawa to Germany, Vancouver
                    to back home here in Halifax. I've had a great career and many wonderful experiences along the way.<bR><br>
                    Unfortunately working in kitchens is no longer a viable career option, so my focus has turned to tech.
                    A career in Tech will allow me to retain my creative edge while giving me a wider platform to show the world what I can do. </p>

        <p>This is my resume from when I was a chef.  You'll notice there are some overlapping skills and 
             abilities. This is because working in tech and working in a kitchen are actually quite similar 
             when you break it down. Everyone completes their individual jobs to create one amazing meal for customers.
             The same holds true when working on small pieces of code, that when put together makes something great!</p>
